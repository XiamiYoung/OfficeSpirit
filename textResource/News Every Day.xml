<name>0729 - Maradona</name>
<content>Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Argentina's top soccer officials lied to and betrayed coach Diego Maradona in deciding not to renew his contract, he told reporters.

"Grondona lied to me; Bilardo betrayed me," said the 49-year-old former star player for Argentina's national team, referring to Argentine Football Association President Julio Grondona and AFA General Manager Carlos Bilardo.

Argentina's 4-0 loss to Germany in a quarterfinal match put the team out of the World Cup competition. After the team's elimination, according to Maradona, Grondona told him, "in the presence of witnesses and players, that he was very content with the work done and that he wanted it to continue."

But once the team returned to Argentina, "Grondona told me that he wanted me to continue as the coach, but that seven people from my coaching squad would have to go," Maradona said Wednesday. "That was impossible for me to agree to do."

He added, "I have different codes and morals than they do; my parents taught me that."

Maradona said that, "while we were in mourning, Bilardo was working in the shadows to throw me out."

I have different codes and morals than they do; my parents taught me that

--Diego Maradona, sacked Argentina national team coach
 
After reading from a prepared speech for 12 minutes, he left without taking questions as many of the assembled journalists applauded.

After meeting with officials at AFA headquarters in Buenos Aires, Grondona told reporters that he had not lied to Maradona. Though the two men had talked about change, "it was not my intention to open the exit door for him," he said.

He said he did not understand how Maradona could believe he was betrayed. "We were looking for some change, not to get rid of Maradona," he said.

Bilardo said he would respond next week to Maradona's accusations.

<name>0729 - Joint South Korea-U.S. drills enter fourth day</name>
<content>(CNN) -- The United States and South Korea on Wednesday plan to end their joint military exercises aimed at warning North Korea to stop acts of aggression.

The military exercises, dubbed Invincible Spirit, are in waters off South Korea. They include 8,000 personnel, 20 ships and submarines, and about 200 aircraft, officials said.

U.S. Defense Department officials said the drills are in response to the March sinking of the South Korean warship, Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors.

South Korea has said that an investigation concluded that a North Korean submarine fired a torpedo that sunk the South Korea warship, an assertion the North has denied.

The drills are intended to send a strong message to Pyongyang to stop "provocative and warlike acts," the U.S. Defense Department said.

The drills will include anti-sub infiltration exercises, said Cmdr. Jeff Davis of the U.S. 7th Fleet.

"The anti-sub-infiltration exercise works like this: if a sub is coming in to attack a ship, the military finds it and prosecutes it," he said.

Davis said there was a "renewed desire" and urgency to focus on the exercise after the Cheonan sinking. North Korea has criticized the exercises.

"The U.S. provocations amount to trespassing on the off-limits fixed by the DPRK and it, therefore, feels no need to remain bounded to the off-limits drawn by the U.S.," the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman as saying.

It continued, "It is the mode of the DPRK's counteraction to react to sword brandishing in kind. The DPRK is prepared for both dialogue and war. It will remain unfazed by military threat and sanctions."

Earlier, North Korea had heightened its threats against the military exercises.

North Korea "will legitimately counter with [its] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces," KCNA reported.

Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan downplayed the threats from North Korea. 

"I think North Korea is just too interested in their own survival to do anything that could end that regime," Levin said Sunday on C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" program.

<name>0730 - This is not the end for Maradona</name>
<content>Much of Diego Maradona's life has seemed to play out at a different level to ordinary mortals, so it was no surprise that the announcement of his departure as Argentina coach was spiced with high drama.

Maradona raised the temperature by countering a bland statement from the Argentine football authorities that his contract had not been renewed (because of his refusal to countenance a change to some of his technical team,) with a visceral attack on his alleged enemies.

He accused national team director Carlos Bilardo of betrayal, and Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Association, of being part of a conspiracy to unjustly oust him. 

Maradona: I was lied to and betrayed

There is nothing Diego likes more than to be placed in a situation where he can rally his believers round a claim of martyrdom by sinister powers. He did so when he was busted for drugs back in the early 1990s, and he did it again when he tested positive in the football World Cup in the U.S. in 1994.

He arrived at the World Cup in South Africa, already hitting back at all those journalists who had noted his apparent incompetence as a coach and predicting failure from the outset. Such antagonism fuels his popularity among the downtrodden and dispossessed. But I am not alone in believing his protests are actually an attempt to cover up his own professional and personal failings.

Maradona, in the end, badly let down his team of superstars

--Jimmy Burns

World Cup Soccer 
If this were happening in another country, then the reason for Maradona's sacking should be plain. He may once have been a great player, and he brought us some entertainment in an otherwise rather dull World Cup in South Africa (La Roja's justified victory excluded,) but Argentina's thrashing by Germany exposed his shortcomings as a coach, and the lack of professionalism of some of his hand-picked advisers, which had been a subject of public debate for well over a year.

In the end, the myth of Diego's divinity -- the "hand of God" -- was brought crashing down by a German team that played better because they were coached better. The Argentinean team realized belatedly that Maradona's genius lay in personal instinct rather than in any system, and there was a limit to what that could achieve.

You may bring a smile to global TV audiences by kissing your players and dancing like a pogo stick each time your side scores a goal, but you need technique and strategy, not just inspiration, to win a championship, and Maradona, in the end, badly let down his team of superstars.

But then this is Argentina -- a country where politics and football make a potent mix. Maradona not only has a popular following among his country's more fanatical football fans, but continues to be looked at as a political vehicle by sectors of the populist government of Cristina Fernandes. Which is why I doubt this is the final chapter of the flawed genius's extraordinary life.

On the psychological front, there are testing times ahead for Maradona, and thus for the Argentine nation. His self-proclaimed dream was to coach his national team to World Cup victory. He failed in South Africa, but afterwards said he would do it, next time, when the tournament is played in neighboring Brazil.

Without the motivation that the coach's job provided, some of his fans fear he may return to the bad old days of depression, self abuse and intensifying paranoia.

The myth of Maradona's invincibility has been severely dented and may prove irrevocable. But he has been down before, and fought back. There will be more dramas ahead -- of that I am sure.

<content>A pair of oil pipeline blasts engulfed a Chinese port in flames for 15 hours before firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze, state-run media reported.

The fire was far from residential areas and no casualties were reported, government spokesman in the northeastern coastal city of Dalian told the Xinhua news agency.

More than 2,000 firefighters and 338 fire engines from 14 cities across Liaoning province worked through the night to put out the fire, Xinhua said.

What saddens me more than the worldwide ecological suffering we're going through these days is the sheer number of uninformed people sharing fear-mongering opinions. You can't apply one countries standards to another, that's apples and oranges. Surely it's naive to think our own governments report the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth. What's the difference between our governments using the media to fuel the desired public opinion and China choosing not to report the darker sides of some issues? Seems like the semantics of social engineering to me. China's policies regarding news media and it's control were put in place to help ensure a harmonious society. Chinese people are passionate and quick tempered. Showing blood and death doesn't always serve the best interests of the people, least of all those that have fallen. Rest assured those that died will be duly honored by their families privately. A public spectacle or a private memorial? Think about your own family and what you'd rather have. 
If people spent more time trying to find things to do to get people to look up to them rather than trying to find a reason to look down on others, imagine what the world could achieve. Sitting behind the illusion of anonymity that the internet provides is empowering. It seems such a shame that it's so often used to propagate misunderstanding and hate. We should celebrate and enjoy our differences now as the world would be so incredibly boring were we are all cookie-cutter clones battered in consumerism and deep-fried in a singular political dogma. less

China will catch up soon. Believe me, people are buying cars like candy. I see more people driving gas guzzling SUVs in China than I do in L.A. Not to mention the fact that nobody recycles and everyone has air conditioning units. When Beijing was bidding for the Olympics and the committee visited, they had rolling power cuts throughout the city in order to clear the layer of smog that blocks out the blue sky. Trust me, the sky is not something you ever get to see in any Chinese city. 

This isn't a competition. It's not a larger or smaller disaster than the one in the Gulf. These two isolated incidents should only serve as a cautionary tale: that industry always comes at a price. I wonder how long and how much we're willing to pay before we come to our senses. less

<name>0730 - When phones are too big for pockets</name>
<content>(CNN) -- Something weird is happening to mobile phones: After shrinking from enormous Zack Morris proportions in the '80s and '90s, they're getting bigger again.

So big, in fact, that some won't fit in jeans pockets anymore.

The Dell Streak, which is set to be released in the U.S. later this summer, is the biggest of the big-daddy phones so far, with a 5-inch screen. The screen of the iPhone 4, by comparison, measures only 3.5 inches diagonally.

When held up to a person's ear, the Dell phone looks like a book.

The Streak's mondo screen has become the focus of much debate on the internet, with tech bloggers arguing about what kinds of pants you'd have to wear to carry it around in your pocket; how big your hands have to be to hold it; whether or not people will stare at you when you're using it; and, perhaps most significantly, what exactly constitutes a phone these days.

Is a phone just any device that can make calls? Or does it have to be portable enough to carry with you, regardless of how baggy your pants are?

As mobile phone technology improved, "there definitely was a trend for smaller and there definitely was a trend for thinner," said Ramon Llamas, a senior research analyst who covers mobile technology for IDC. "But I think we're seeing the pendulum swinging back in favor of larger phones."

Mobile phone makers are trying to "push the boundaries of what is acceptable in a pocket," said Ross Rubin, executive director of industry analysis for consumer technology at the NPD Group.

Several Android phones -- which run on an operating system developed by Google, as opposed to those by Microsoft or Apple -- have come out with screens that are larger than 4 inches diagonally.

The HTC Evo and the Motoroloa Droid X, for example, both have 4.3-inch screens. Sony Ericsson is rumored, according to the blog Engadget, to be working on another 5-inch smartphone, the same size as the Dell Streak. (As a side note, the HTC Evo is so big that it comes with a kickstand).

In video reviews of these ever-larger phones, it seems almost to be a requirement these days for tech pundits to try to shove the things in their pockets as a way to determine whether the devices are truly portable.

In one such video, Veronica Belmont, co-host of a video show called Tekzilla, puts the Dell Streak in the front pocket of her pants only to find that about a third of the phone is still sticking out.

One YouTube video, titled "Dell Streak vs. Jeans," starts with a shot of a man's waist line, shown only from the thighs to mid-belly.

"The reason you're staring at my hips is that I'm going to show you what the Dell Streak is like, fitting in a jeans pocket," the host says. "Now, these jeans have got quite a deep pocket and, even still, it pokes out a little bit over the top. You can tuck it right in and there's still a corner coming out at the top there."

The man then proceeds to stuff the Streak into his back pocket, which he decides isn't such a good idea, either. 

It sticks out, which could make it easily accessible to pickpockets, he says. "And you're certainly not going to want to sit on it."

Dell did not return CNN's phone calls about this story.

The other potential issue with large phones is that it can be difficult to hold them up to your face, depending how big your hands are and if your arms are strong.

When Chris Hall tested the Dell Streak for the British website Pocket-lint, he said his hand literally became tired and stretched-out from holding the phone.

He said he also got some stares from strangers.

"People are going to look at you in a funny way" when you're holding such a large gadget up to your face, he said.

Hall still gave the phone -- which is sometimes referred to as a small "tablet" computer rather than a large phone -- a good rating: 8 of 10 stars.

In a video review for the blog Engadget, Richard Lai takes a bit of a contrarian view, saying the Dell Streak is still small enough to carry comfortably in a standard pant pocket.

"Obviously you see a bit of bulge here," he says after putting the phone in his jeans pocket, "but you get that with any phones these days, really, you know? Sliding it in and out is no problem, you see?"

Lai does note, however, that, if you want to walk up a flight of stairs with the 5-inch phone in your pocket, you should "shift your phone as far to the side [of your pocket] as possible" in order to maintain a normal range of movement.

"But other than that we've had no real issues with it," he says.

Despite some fuss about the bulk of these 4- and 5-inch phones, there are some clear advantages to screens with more real estate. 

As phones increasingly become internet portals, e-book readers and video players, having bigger screens makes them more useful, Llamas said.

Those functions are butting up against some long-held ideas about what a mobile phone is -- namely that it's a gadget that you can easily carry in a pocket and hold to your ear to make a call.

So maybe we need a new cell phone definition: 

One that can fit in your cargo shorts.

Wih the current technology, we will stay with bigger phones for a while and there will not be many complaints. less

Also the HTC Evo doesnt have a kickstand because its so big, it has a kickstand so you can stand it up and watch video on it. What a pointless article. 

And Veronica is the first woman over the age of 13 Ive seen who carries a phone in her pocket. then again from the look of the faded brown jeans and baggy grey t-shirt she is wearing, looking good clearly isnt a concern. Why not just go fully lumberjack and buy some cargo pants Veronica?
Women's wallets are too big for their pockets and I never see any key bulges in jean pockets either. Where is the article on keys and wallets being too big? Heck half the womens pants out their dont even have real pockets, so it seems a nonissue. If you are a man and your phone wont fit in your pocket, buy some looser jeans. less

The only mobile phones getting bigger are the ones coming from computer manufacturers trying to grab a share at the mobile phone market and manufacturing such huge phones to accomodate the "hardware" they are familiar with. 
Real mobile phone manufacturers (Nokia, Sony Erickson, etc) use their experience gained through out the years and have thin, small mobile phones. Their smartphones are certainly larger than their normal mobiles, but still at an acceptable size.

I think the computer manufacturers have to gather also the experience just as the mobile manufacturers did. less

How about the HTC evo and HD2 (HTC being a phone company,) the Motorolla Droid X (motorolla being a phone company,) the Samsung Galaxy s line, etc. 

The "Real" mobile phone manufacturers you refer to seem to be lagging behind in offering robust smartphones that can compete with android. Economics suggests that if a product exists and is successful, its due to the market demanding it. Seeing as sprint and Verizon cant keep up with demand for their 4.3 inch screened smartphones (evo and droid x,) it would appear that a large phone is actually what most premium users want. less

<name>0803 - U.S. drawdown in Iraq proceeding as planned</name>
<content>Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The Obama administration's planned drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq is proceeding "as promised" and should lead to an end of America's combat mission there by the end of August, President Barack Obama said Monday.

Plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to 50,000 by the end of this month are on schedule, Obama told the national convention of Disabled American Veterans. At that point, the U.S. mission will shift to the training and support of Iraqi security forces.

A full withdrawal of American troops from Iraq is scheduled to occur by the end of next year.

The war in Iraq "is nearing an end," he said. "As a candidate for president, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end. And that is exactly what we are doing."

While the U.S. military commitment in Iraq is now nearing a conclusion, the president warned, there is still danger there for U.S. troops on the ground.

Iraq War

"The hard truth is we have not seen the end of American sacrifice in Iraq," Obama said. "But make no mistake, our commitment in Iraq is changing -- from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats."

Obama's update on the conflict in Iraq came in the context of a wide-ranging speech addressing several issues tied to national security and veterans' benefits.

Obama defended his decision to increase U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan -- a decision criticized by some of the more liberal members of his own party. He said the military has now gone on the offensive against extremist elements, and took issue with critics who claim the U.S. end game in Afghanistan remains poorly defined.

"We face huge challenges in Afghanistan," he said. "But it's important that the American people know that we are making progress and we're focused on goals that are clear and achievable."

"If Afghanistan were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency, al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack." 

"As president of the United States, I refuse to let that happen," he said.

The Pakistan government has begun to "take the fight to violent extremists within its borders. Major blows have been struck against al Qaeda and its leadership," Obama said.

On Iraq, the president provided a largely optimistic assessment of the U.S. effort, saying violence there is currently "near the lowest it's been in years."

But Iraqi officials released data Saturday that they said shows July was the deadliest month for civilians since May 2008, reporting that 396 civilians, 50 Iraqi soldiers and 89 police officers were killed. Iraqi officials also said 100 so-called "terrorists" were killed, and 955 others were detained.

The U.S. military has disputed the Iraqi figures, saying the actual numbers are less than half what Iraq's government reported.

The U.S. command in Baghdad, Iraq, "refutes that 535 people were killed in Iraq during the month of July," the military said in a statement Sunday. It put the total number of people killed by "enemy action" at 222, including 161 civilians, 55 Iraqi troops and six Americans -- the ninth-lowest civilian casualty count since January 2008, according to the U.S. military.

The U.S. military has said it believes Iraqi security forces can maintain current levels of relative stability, but that sentiment is not shared by many Iraqis.

Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said in a recent interview with CNN that he is concerned that "the security is declining ... [and] that's why we need really good resolutions, we need to expedite the formation of a government and we need to create an understanding in the region, and we need the help of the United States to facilitate all of these issues through its good offices in Iraq and elsewhere in the region."

Starting in September, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq -- 50,000 -- will be almost a third of the total number there when Obama took office in January 2009, the White House has said. There will be 96,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan -- more than three times the number there at the beginning of Obama's term.

In July, there were 81,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 87,000 in Afghanistan.

While there is sharp public division over the U.S. effort in Afghanistan, Americans largely support the removal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Nearly two-thirds of all Americans back the administration's plan to remove most troops by the end of August, according to a May 21-23 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. 

Only 36 percent of Americans favor the war in Iraq, the survey indicated.

Obama offered praise Monday for all the veterans of major U.S. military conflicts since World War II.

"In the life of our nation, not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need. But every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and courage," he told the enthusiastic crowd.

The president ran through a litany of administration initiatives for military veterans, including "dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board."

Among the initiatives he highlighted: an increased use of electronic record-keeping that will allow veterans, for the first time, to go to the VA's website and download or print personal health records "so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside the VA." 

The new measure will take effect this fall, he said.

"...a civilian effort led by our diplomats..."

Uh, don't forget the tens of thousands of "contractors" (mercenaries) who have been used in quasi-combat roles for years now, allowing us to appear to have a smaller military presence. They will still be there, killing and being killed, but not shown as "combat" related casualties. When the funding for them is finally cut off, you can safely assume that anarchy and civil war are right around the corner, and a new generation of terrorists will have a safe haven. This "war" is reaching nothing like a successful conclusion.
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we'll finally be done with it, and I'll be totally relieved when we conduct the same graceful abandonment...er....drawdown in Afghanistan. I hope this is the last time we make this sort of mistake, but since we heard there'd never be another Vietnam we can probably assume this is a mistake this country will continue to make. less

<name>0804 - Gunman suspected of killing 8 had just been forced to resign</name>
<content>Manchester, Connecticut (CNN) -- Omar Thornton, 34, walked into a room early Tuesday at the beverage distributorship where he worked in Manchester, Connecticut. 

Company and union officials played a video. He calmly watched images that purportedly showed him stealing from a truck.

An employee of Hartford Distributors for two years and a driver for one, Thornton was given a choice of resigning or being fired, union and company officials said.

He signed a resignation paper, was escorted out of the room and toward the door. He asked for a drink of water, company CEO Ross Hollander told CNN. That's when all hell broke loose. Thornton pulled out a handgun and began firing, officials said.

Within minutes, the gunman and eight other people were dead, and two others were wounded, according to Manchester police and a union official. Police swarmed to the scene, but never had a chance to talk with Thornton, who apparently shot himself to death in an office.

The shootings left the company, city and state in shock. Relatives and acquaintances said Thornton was known for his calm demeanor.

"My heart and prayers go out to the employees and families of the victims," Gov. M. Jodi Rell said in a statement. "In the wake of this tragedy, we are all left asking the same questions: How could someone do this? Why did they do this? It was a senseless act of violence that has left us all shaken. ..."



Video: Workplace shooting in Connecticut As police investigate the shootings and prepare to identify its victims, the company will meet with employees, some of whom have been with Hartford for 30-40 years.

A girlfriend of Thornton indicated he was a victim of racial harassment at the beverage center, the mother of the girlfriend told CNN.

Thornton told his girlfriend he had reported to a company supervisor and a union representative about the harassment but they did nothing about it, Joanne Hannah said Tuesday.

Teamsters officials deny allegations that Thornton, who was black, snapped because of racial harassment.

Eight people were killed in various parts of the facility, Police Chief Marc Montminy said, and one shot may have been fired outside. 

"There were clearly some performance issues," Montminy said.

Chris Roos, secretary and treasurer of Teamsters Local 1035, which represents the company's drivers, said Thornton had been accused of stealing "product" off a beer truck on two separate occasions.

Roos said Steve Hollander, a company vice president injured in the shooting spree, provided details of the 7 a.m. meeting.

"Omar asked if he could resign, and he signed a resignation paper. The meeting was over. They were walking out of the meeting, and that's when it all happened," Roos said.

Bryan Cirigliano, 51, the shop steward for the union and the union's president, was in the meeting. He was among those killed, Roos said. Other victims were found throughout the facility, police said.

"He was a great guy. Unbelievable family man, " Roos said of Cirigliano. "Very community-active. Loved his daughters, loved his wife."

Joanne Hannah said Thornton showed her daughter, Kristie, a cell phone photo of racial epithets and a stick figure with a noose around its neck drawn on a restroom stall. He was in a stall once and heard a co-worker say "they wanted that n----- out of there," she said.

She said Thornton was one of two black employees. "This poor guy got pushed to the limit."

Kristie Hannah and Thornton spent Monday night in Enfield together, Joanne Hannah said. "She said he acted his normal self."

Joanne Hannah said Thornton got a pistol permit about two years ago. She said she was unaware of the allegations of theft levied against Thornton, a truck driver, but she doubted he was guilty. "He was too honest."

Roos said Thornton never filed a racial complaint with the union or a government agency.

"This had nothing to do with racial stuff. This was a sick individual. He just snapped," Roos said.

James Battaglio, a spokesman for the family that owns the distributorship, said he had no information about the allegations of harassment. 

Hannah and relatives of Thornton said the suspected gunman called his mother Tuesday morning and said he had shot five people.

Thornton's uncle, Will Holliday, told CNN affiliate WFSB that in the call, the suspected shooter said, "'I killed the five racists that was there that was bothering me' and he said that's it, the cops are going to come in so I'm going to take care of myself."

Police would not release identities of the dead late Tuesday. Montminy said he did not know how many were specifically targeted.

Company receptionist Marissa Busiere told CNN affiliate WFSB she heard another co-worker screaming after shots rang out inside the business.

"'He's shooting! He's shooting! Call 911.' And everyone started running out of the building," Busiere said.

At the time, there were about 35 or 40 people in the office and warehouse, Brett Hollander, the director of marketing and a member of the family that owns the company, told the Hartford Courant. 

Three people were rushed to Hartford Hospital, and one of them later died, a doctor told reporters. Police declined to say how many people were wounded.

"Everyone is devastated by this tragic and senseless act," Battaglio, the spokesman for the Hollander family, told the Courant. He said the family intends to focus its attention on the families of the victims.

"[The family is] mourning. They're meeting tomorrow morning [Wednesday] with employees, away from the site," said Battaglio. "They want to meet in private, an opportunity for people to grieve and to come together and to address the remainder of their family members, meaning their employees."

"This is a tight-knit organization. This is tragic, this is senseless. In addition, they lost people with whom they've been extremely close to over the decades," Battaglio told CNN.

At least one nearby business was closed Tuesday afternoon.

"Pray for the families of the people at Hartford Distributors," a recorded phone message at Fluid Dynamics said.

Roos said employees are still reeling after the violence.

"I'm devastated. I'm trying to think how I'm going to get nine families' lives back in order again and help them cope with this. How can we help them cope with this situation? We're going to try to get employee-assistance people and union therapists to help and speak with these guys," he said.

On the other hand, I also think he should have been discriminated against otherwise he has not lost it. The fact that he bought the gun with him on the meeting day shows that he intended to kill the people he was about to meet and then kill himself. I don't think being caught stealing some beer was not big of a deal that drove this guy to this horrible homicide and so shameful enough for him to kill himself.
I have no doubts there should be some degree of racial discrimination at play here. less

If you fear or hate another race it's because you are weak. Yes, racism exist in the U.S. and yes we are still fighting this. Maybe we will never be one, but to fear or hate another man because of their skin color is nothing but a sign of weakness and insecurity. So, to all you kids posting hate..just sit back and think about that for a minute. Learn how to be proud without hate. less

<name>0805 - Everything to play for: Eyeing China's online games market</name>
<content>Aside from the hundreds of new games on display at ChinaJoy that ran from July 28 to Aug. 1 in Shanghai, there was also something else new -- more foreigners, specifically foreign gaming companies hoping to partner with Chinese companies to either import their games to China or export China’s games abroad. 

They came from Australia, Russia, Germany, France, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and around 30 or so other countries, setting up booths at ChinaJoy, China’s largest gaming and digital entertainment exhibition (the country's answer to E3), and speaking at several gaming conferences held in conjunction with the event. 

 
The [Chinese companies] want to do business ... It is the birth of a new market, really
— Martin Wilkes, sales and business manager for Firelight TechnologiesIt is a trend that many say will only grow in coming years as foreign game developers and publishers want a piece of China’s lucrative gaming market, which was worth more than US$3 billion in 2009 according to Niko Partners, and as cash-rich Chinese companies like Tencent Holdings and Shanda Games try their luck in the West. 

Tencent recently invested US$300 million in Digital Sky Technologies, the Russian Internet holding company that acquired a stake in Facebook last year, and Shanda Games, a subsidiary of Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited, purchased San Francisco-based Mochi Media for US$80 million in January. 

Meanwhile, Zynga, the San Francisco-based company known for its social networking game Farmville, acquired XPD Media, a social gaming company based in Beijing in May. 

“There is a lot of stuff happening between the East and the West right now,” says Ludovic Bodin, co-founder and CEO of Cmune, a Beijng-based company that builds 3D games for social networks. “Everyone is trying to work with each other.” 

Changing tides
Once considered mediocre at best, “the increased quality and technological complexity of online games made in China is fueling interest from foreign publishers hoping to help domestic developers release their products overseas,” says Carsten van Husen, CEO of the German-based online game publisher Gameforge.  

(Article continues after the photo)


 Chinese gamers pack into ChinaJoy alongside game developers for China's online gaming event of the year.During the conferences, which included sessions on the global development of Chinese games and global social games and “their Chinese hopes,” Gameforge signed its first deal to distribute Warrior King, a MMO (massively multi-player online) game produced by Beijing-based LineKong Entertainment Technology, in the West. 

“Korea has always been leading the industry but the Chinese are obviously very clever, creative and massive, so they are coming on strong,” van Husen says. 

Yet while Chinese gaming companies have been investing internationally and there are a few examples of Chinese social network games that have been successful abroad (Sunshine Ranch, a SNS game developed by Rekoo, has performed well in Japan and the United State, for example), some say it will be a while before Chinese developers can make any major inroads in the West largely due to cultural divides and lack of market expertise. 

 
There is a lot of stuff happening between the East and the West right now. Everyone is trying to work with each other.
— Ludovic Bodin, co-founder and CEO of Cmune“It will take another few years,” Bodin says. “For most of them, they are going to buy companies that are strong in [other] markets or can serve as a bridge between the East and the West.” 

Technical interruptions
Cultural barriers as well as hard-to-navigate regulations, including a law passed last fall banning foreign investment in domestic online gaming operations, could also make it difficult for foreign game companies to enter China. 

Still, there are those who remain determined to take a share of the world’s largest Internet population entrenched in a lucrative culture of online games. 

“The Chinese market has moved dramatically in terms of technology,” says Martin Wilkes, sales and business manager for Firelight Technologies, a Melbourne-based company that provides audio solutions for video games. “Games have become part of the Chinese culture and will only increase in potential because of the size of the population.” 

Wilkes was accompanied by 10 other Australian companies on a “Victorian Government ICT trade mission to Shanghai” to explore business opportunities in China. 

“The [Chinese companies] want to do business. They are really eager and very approachable and very keen to talk,” he says. “It is the birth of a new market, really.”

<name>0809 - What does 'video game' mean, anyway?</name>
<content>Editor's note: Scott Steinberg is the head of technology and video game consulting firm TechSavvy Global as well as the founder of GameExec magazine and Game Industry TV. The creator and host of online video series Game Theory, he frequently appears as an on-air technology analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and CNN. 

(CNN) -- From plummeting sales to a shift to social networks, critics love to endlessly debate what ails the gaming business. 

But ironically, the biggest problem of all may be that there is no singular "games industry" to speak of anymore, and that the term "video game" itself is hopelessly outdated. 

"I've never seen a period like this ... there's so much disruption," Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins recently said on the online video show "Game Theory." "The industry is really being turned inside out." 

Credit the rise of new technologies -- from downloadable games to smartphone apps -- streaming "cloud" games and social network titles. 

Free games playable in your Web browser, electronic amusements based around the sale of bite-sized virtual goods ("microtransactions") and massively multiplayer online worlds are also on the upswing. Simultaneously, tightened household spending is forcing players to look more toward episodic and downloadable content such as new maps, missions and story add-ons that extend the life of games they already own.

Unfortunately for industry titans like Activision and Electronic Arts, most modern forms of electronic entertainment have about as much to do with games like "Call of Duty" and "Mass Effect" as Apple does quilting. 

Digital diversions built for new platforms like Facebook and the iPhone aren't just designed to be played in completely different methods and manners. They're meant to be enjoyed in different context and timeframes, and constantly updated and refined based on player feedback, defining them more as services than products. 

"A lot of the established players [including] retailers and publishers are worried," said "Oddworld" creator Lorne Lanning. "They have good reason to be. People are finding experiences and products elsewhere, and different businesses are emerging that large infrastructure companies aren't used to adapting to, and a lot of them won't be able to adapt to. 

"Anyone who thinks that they're deeply entrenched ... is fooling themselves." 

As he explains, it's one thing to sell a copy of "Metroid: Other M," which costs a fixed price, offers everyone essentially the same experience and lasts a few hours before being put down. It's another to build a 3-D online universe such as "Free Realms" or social game such as "FrontierVille," which have to stay relevant for years and offer reasons to keep clicking day after day. 

The shift has made for many bleak months of retail software performance. Most recently, sales of games for PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360 and popular handheld consoles slumped a whopping 15 percent to $531 million in June, according to market research firm NPD. 

"Everyone was caught figuratively with their pants down," said Epic Games design director Cliff Bleszinski of the shift to online, digital and social alternatives. "Everybody in the industry is still trying to figure out how to make blockbuster games in this day and age."

Independent game designer Clint Hocking, most recently responsible for "Far Cry 2," wholeheartedly agrees with these sentiments. "[Game industry insiders] stood around saying for so long that the game industry is immune to the recession," he said. "But we're not." 

Origin and Portalarium founder Richard "Lord British" Garriott predicts a radical shift for the business, citing that those who choose to accept it will flourish, while those who don't are doomed. 

But as insiders are all quick to point out, upsides are also plentiful for video game fans. 

More than 40,000 games are now available that speak to all ages and interests, and at a broader range of prices than ever, on the iPhone and iPad. Sales of PC digital downloads have either caught up to or surpassed retail purchases as of 2009 as well, depending on which analyst you ask. 

"The industry will be healthy, is not headed for doom, and we're entertaining more people in more ways than ever before," said Naughty Dog co-founder Jason Rubin. "But from a profitability standpoint, the [blockbuster] console stuff is not quite working."

At this point, it's a little premature to write the pastime off. 

Instead of debating what ails gaming as a whole, maybe we'd do better to take a deeper look at the fundamental changes responsible for these painful upheavals. 

Not to mention, that is, wake up and realize that "video games" can't all be lumped into the same single grouping any more, or viewed through the same myopic lens.

In this article they mention a shift in the market and how there are new medium for gaming i.e. browsers games and social networking site games (farmville) etc. I would argue that these aren't a shift but an expansion.

The customer base of games is expanded rather than shifting and all it is doing is creating different classes of gamer. My granny plays farmville and my mum plays the WII, this doesn't represent a shift away from traditional gaming because I'm pretty sure I never played Golden Eye on the N64 with either of them.

I also find the whole 'recession hitting hard' thing hard to believe when you consider Blizz just made $3.5 million selling a BTA mount. (A horse you can ride in the World of Warcraft game). less

I'm left wondering if CNN could have found a larger collection of douchebags to interview. Seriously, I laughed out loud at the laundry list of "luminaries" quoted here -- washed up, left the industry, attention white hacks. Of course the guys you interviewed were caught with their pants down! They're idiots! How about interviewing those who *did* see thus coming -- Blizzard, Zynga, hell even EA's own Maxis. 

Look, I'm a video game designer by profession. I come up with the user interactions in digital interactive entertainment. I've worked on MMORPGs, single player RPGs, mobile games, and social network games. Any game designer worth his or her salt can move across game genres and platforms and design an experience hat will be entertaining and valuable to the target audience. Everyone else should get out of the game industry asap. As an "insider" myself, I welcome these changes, and hope they signal the death of dinosaurs such as the men quoted in this article. less

The game industry needs to learn the real lesson here. Start putting more effort into games, make them enjoyable and stop trying to sell us games that are not worth playing. The industry will die if they don't figure this out soon. less

<name>0817 - Pentagon report: China extending military reach</name>
<content>Washington (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to expand its reach and capabilities beyond its immediate geographical area, a new report from the U.S. Department of Defense concludes.

The report, an annual assessment sent to Congress, notes that some of those capabilities have been positive, like humanitarian and anti-piracy efforts, but others are meant to give China "extended-range power projection."

While China's continued effort to be able to sustain military operations far from its shore are concerning to the U.S. military, "China's ability to sustain military power at a distance, today, remains limited," the report says.

As in the past, the U.S. program to sell military equipment to Taiwan continues to create tension with China and has led to cessation at times of military relations between the two countries.

The assessment notes that China has the most active ballistic and cruise missile program in the world, including developing anti-missile technology. Also of concern are Chinese efforts to develop a long-range anti-ship ballistic missile with a reach of more than 900 miles, which would include areas in which the U.S. Navy is active. Such a measure would give the Chinese military "the capability to attack ships, including aircraft carriers, in the Western Pacific Ocean," according to the report.

The Chinese could start building their first aircraft carrier this year, and China has started to train pilots to operate off such carriers. It already has a Russian carrier that it is refurbishing.

Its naval muscle is also being flexed with additional nuclear powered submarines, and it has nearly completed a navy base on Hainan Island, "with direct access to vital international sea lanes," which will allow for "stealthy deployment of submarines," the report says.

<name>0818 - Colombia survivors: A normal flight, then a crash on the runway</name>
<content>(CNN) -- Aires Airlines Flight 8250 was seconds away from landing at San Andres airport on a small island off the coast of Colombia. The pilot had turned on the seat belt sign and told passengers to stay in their seats. Passengers could see rain and lightning outside their small cabin windows, but nothing was amiss. Everything seemed calm. Normal. Routine.

Then a hard, violent crash as the Boeing 737-700 smacked into the runway. The plane started to break apart, and sparks flew as metal ground against concrete. Seats came loose from their moorings and tumbled about the cabin. Passengers could see the runway and the rainy predawn sky through the gaping holes left in the sheared fuselage. Some of them fell to the ground, still strapped into their seats.

Survivors of Monday's plane crash that left one person dead and more than 120 injured describe nearly two hours of normalcy followed by minutes of sheer terror.

"Everything was going well," Heriberto Rua told Radio Caracol. "When I felt something, it was the crash."

Another passenger, Juan Carlos Hurtado, said everything was fine until the moment of landing about 1:49 a.m. (2:49 a.m. ET).

Air Disasters 
"No sooner had the rear wheels touched down when it started to break apart," he told Radio Caracol. "It broke apart, and the seats were torn loose. We ended up seeing the road, and it started to catch on fire. There were many people wounded, screaming."

Industrial engineer Jose Ricardo Ramirez said he was ejected from the ruptured plane.

"The truth is that I can't say whether the plane got to roll down the runway," Ramirez told Radio Caracol. "Simply, when we fell down, we ended up on the pavement, chairs and all."

Ramirez said his first inclination was to unbuckle his seat belt and then undo his wife's restraint.

A couple and their three children were traveling behind him, Ramirez said. He noticed that a plane seat was lying on top of the man. He lifted the seat off him and then noticed that his own wife's face was covered in blood.

"I immediately grabbed her and tried to get her away because flames were coming from the plane," Ramirez said. "We tried to get away, but because my wife had a broken knee, I had to help remove her.

"A police patrol arrived minutes later, and they helped us and brought us to the clinic, where we were tended to as soon as possible."

Two residents of the metro Atlanta, Georgia, area were among those seriously injured.

Carolina Bellino said she and her husband, David, suffered fractured backs. She cannot move, Bellino said.

"He is worse than mine," she told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Tuesday.

Bellino, who said she is seven or eight weeks pregnant, recalled that she prayed until rescuers arrived.

"It's just like a nightmare, but I'm thankful because I'm alive," she said.

"It's a new beginning for us. You know you realize you can lose your life in just 20 seconds."

Colombian authorities say they are investigating whether the plane may have been hit by lightning or been buffeted by a severe downdraft.

One of the two pilots stood outside the wrecked plane shortly after the crash and described to a police videographer the flight's final moments. CNN affiliate Caracol TV played the recording Tuesday.

"We were caught in a great sinking as we reached the runway, as our wheels touched down," said the unnamed pilot, his face bloodied. "It threw us out. It threw us out. Nature is very strong."

The pilot paced back and forth before the camera, recounting his ordeal as crews worked on the plane just a few yards away.

"It grabbed us with everything it had," the pilot said. "I said, 'Landing' and cut, and when I was cutting, I started to level off, and I felt that the plane was going straight (down).

"I pulled [on the stick]. I pulled. I pulled. And the plane kept on going, kept on going. It was when we said, 'Landing.' When there's nothing left to do."

Survivors said they were unaware that anything had happened to the aircraft until the violent impact.

Ramirez, the industrial engineer, said he had seen lightning outside his window as the plane approached the airport.

"[But] I didn't feel any explosion," he told Caracol. "It's a miracle from God. Thanks to God we are all alive."

Hurtado also said he was unaware of any lightning striking the plane, as reported by some officials on the ground.

"That's what people say," Hurtado said. "Others [say] that the landing gear did not go down. But I don't know what happened. Only that it was horrible."

<name>0819 - Last U.S. combat convoy has left Iraq</name>
<content>Mosul, Iraq (CNN) -- The last U.S. brigade combat team has left Iraq, leaving about 56,000 U.S. troops in the country, according to the U.S. military.

Capt. Christopher Ophardt, spokesman for the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, said the last of the 4,000 members of the unit were in armored vehicles crossing the border into Kuwait early Thursday.

A few hundred members stayed behind to finish administrative and logistical duties but will fly out of Baghdad later Thursday, Ophardt said.

Much of the brigade departed more than a day ago, but the announcement was delayed for security reasons.

Their departure comes more than seven years after U.S. combat forces entered, though their departure does not signify the end of all U.S. combat forces in the country.

Another 6,000 U.S. troops must leave Iraq to meet President Barack Obama's September 1 deadline for the end of U.S. combat operations in the country and the beginning of Operation New Dawn, in which U.S. forces are expected to play an advise-and-assist role.

A public information officer at Fort Lewis, Washington, said it will take a few weeks for all of the 4-2's members to return home. "It is one flight at a time," she said. "We are expecting most of them to be home by mid-September."

As they prepared to depart, some soldiers laughed and some expressed relief at having survived multiple deployments. A few reminisced about having endured firefights and helping carry the bodies of buddies off the field of battle. Many said they would never forget the war.

"The first time you get shot at, it's just, I mean, it wakes you up," said Sgt. Terry Wetzel, the company's senior sniper. "You think, before you come here, that you're an adult, that you're a grown man. But this place will change you."

Wetzel said he was ready to go home. "I feel like we have done as much as we can do here now. It's pretty much up to the Iraqi army and Iraqi police and their government," he said. "We have helped them out as much as we can."

"We put our blood, sweat and tears since we've been here for 12 months and we know we did our job and we know it's not going to be in vain, but there's a lot of excitement right now," said Spc. Don Lanpher as he prepared to depart.

"We're keeping the promise that we've made when I began my campaign for the presidency," U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio, where he was attending a Democratic fundraiser. "By the end of this month ... our combat mission will be over in Iraq."

Obama said that more than 90,000 U.S. troops have left Iraq in the past 18 months.

"And, consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year," he said.

According to the Pentagon, 4,419 U.S. troops have died in Iraq.

For many of them have been back and forth to Iraq since it started, some 6, 7, and 8 times. Now that we're almost done there, which all of our troops should be out by next August, it's time to get my comrades out of Afghanistan. Mr. President, if you want to continue nation building in countries, why not start with our own. We need the help! We can send food, water, etc. to other countries during crisis but we can't end our own homelessness in America. It's time to rebuild America for all people, black, white, latino, asian, KKK, Black Panthers, Bloods, Crypts, etc. If there is not changes being made by our leaders, how can we expect the different cultures, regions, gangs, supremacist, and others to change?

<name>0820 - China: Mechanical failures to blame for North Korean plane crash</name>
<content>Beijing, China (CNN) -- Mechanical failures caused a North Korean air force plane to lose direction before crashing in northeastern China earlier this week, state media quoted Chinese authorities as saying Thursday.

China's official Xinhua news agency said that Pyongyang has apologized to Beijing for the incident and the two sides have "reached a consensus on dealing with the aftermath."

The plane went down Tuesday at Lagu township in Fushun county, killing the pilot and destroying one home on the ground. The crash site in Liaoning province is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) away from a North Korean air base in the border town of Sinuiju, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

An employee at Songgang Iron Mine, a company near the crash site, told CNN Wednesday that armed police officers and special forces agents immediately cordoned off the area after the plane went down.

Photographs of the wreckage purportedly taken by an eyewitness have been circulating on Chinese websites, showing the North Korean air force emblem on the fuselage beneath the tail of the aircraft. Military enthusiasts online have identified it as a Russian-built MiG jet but differed on the specific model, with some calling it a MiG-21 fighter and others claiming it to be a MiG-15 trainer.

Xinhua's latest report did not give details on the plane.

Yonhap had earlier quoted unnamed sources in South Korea as saying the plane's pilot may have been trying to defect from North Korea to Russia. Chinese commentators had speculated that the plane may have run out of fuel.

<name>0823 - How 12 dog breeds got their names</name>
<content>(Mental Floss) -- Every dog owner knows why they gave their dog its name, but how well do you know the story behind their breed names? Let's take a look at where a handful of common breeds found their monikers.

1. Jack Russell Terrier

Yep, Jack Russell was a real guy. 

John Russell was born in Dartmouth, England in 1795, and over the years he became quite a hunting enthusiast. While he was studying to become a clergyman at Oxford, he met a milkman who had a white terrier bitch named Trump who seemed to be the perfect dog for fox hunting. 

After convincing the milkman to sell him the dog, Russell began breeding Trump to develop a line of terriers with the stamina to hunt foxes all day and the courage to go after game that had slipped into holes.

Russell actually has two dogs named after him. We're all familiar with the Jack Russell terrier, but the Parson Russell terrier, a similar breed with longer legs, also takes its name from Russell and is recognized as a separate breed.

Acts of Good Sportsmanship

2. Lhasa Apso

The little dog's name sounds funny, but its origins are pretty straightforward. The Lhasa Apso was originally bred as a watchdog for Tibetan palaces and monasteries; it was hard for an intruder to sneak in past the watchful, yipping pooches. 

The "Lhasa" in the name comes from the city of Lhasa, Tibet's longtime capital. Apso is a Tibetan word meaning "bearded," so the breed's name signifies that it's a longhaired dog that originated in Tibet.

3. Basset Hound

The lovable big-eared hounds don't get their name from a person named Basset. Rather, "Basset" comes from the French word bas for "low" and refers to the dogs' low-slung statures.

4. Cairn Terrier

These feisty little terriers originated in the Scottish Highlands, where they were renowned for their abilities as hunters of rats and other small prey like rabbits. 

The dogs were particularly adept at hunting in the cairns, manmade piles of stones that dot the region as navigational markers. Thus, the breed became known as the Cairn terrier.

5. Dalmatian

The spotted breed takes its name from Dalmatia, an Adriatic region that lies mostly within modern-day Croatia. Dalmatians have long been used as sentinels and guard dogs in the region, but it's not entirely clear that they originated there. 

Paintings and writings show Dalmatian-like dogs in various regions of Europe as far back as the 14th century, and the dogs have been used in Dalmatia since at least the 18th century. Since the dog was most commonly associated with the region, it became widely known as the Dalmatian.

6. Poodle

The poodle may be thought of as a fancy, snooty dog today, but it actually had fairly rough-and-tumble origins as a gun dog. Their name reflects their early work as retrievers who would swim out after fallen waterfowl. 

Pudeln was a Low German word that meant "to splash," so these brave retrievers were known as pudelhund, or "water dogs." The word eventually evolved into the English "poodle."

7. Weimaraner

The beautiful grey dogs with the expressive eyes have probably only been around since the 19th century. According to tradition, that's when Grand Duke Karl August of Weimar began to selectively breed hunting dogs that were fast, had strong noses, wouldn't back down from large game like wolves or wildcats, and were smart. 

Karl August's breed allegedly became fashionable among his fellow Weimar noblemen, and the breed gained popularity as a bird-hunting dog as well.

Oh, the Places Your Ashes Will Go!

8. Cocker Spaniel

Spaniels have been around as far back as the 14th century, and these popular pets also got their starts as gun dogs. English hunters prized the dogs' particularly skilled tracking of woodcocks, so the dogs became known as "cockers."

9. Bouvier des Flandres

This herding dog's name is pretty straightforward if you know a bit of French. The breed originated in Flanders, and French farmers who prized their working spirits named the Bouvier des Flandres, which translates into "Cow herder of Flanders."

10. Dachshund

The dachshund is another breed with an unexpectedly ferocious origin. When the breed was first created in the early 17th century, hunters were attempting to create a fearless, elongated dog that could dig its way into a badger's hole and do battle with the tenacious little mammals. 

Their name reflects this early purpose; "dachshund" means "badger dog" in German.

11. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

This spaniel takes its name from King Charles II of Britain, who was often depicted in paintings and tapestries in the company of a small spaniel and was reportedly "seldom seen without his little dogs."

12. Beagle

The exact origins of the word "beagle" are a bit mysterious, but anybody who has spent much time with the breed will believe the most commonly accepted story. The American Kennel Club traces the name back to the 16th century, when the hounds became associated with the French word becguele ("noisy person") thanks to the din of their howls during hunts.

SCY385 I was kind of hoping that someone would explain where my dog gets his breed name from. He's a Bichon Frise which sounds really snooty especially for the type of personality he has. He's more like the Labrador from the movie Marley &amp; Me.

chedar Tell you what, if you can not afford a Lhasa Apso, find a breeder that have two breed. One Pekingese and another Bichon. Their offspring will be 99% Lhasa Apso look alike. It's when you can't not afford a Lhasa Apso that you try to breed them kind of a fake Lhasa Apso at half the price.

Hold on a moment. You are telling someone who cannot afford one dog to get two dogs, breed them, then get, oh, say, five puppies to get something that looks like a Lhasa. Then what do you do with the other four? Have you ever worked out the actual costs of breeding a litter? Only the puppy mills and pet stores make a profit and that is because they cut every corner possible and breed every dog no matter how unsound. Besides, no matter what breed you get or even a mutt, you will have roughly the same expenses raising the dog. It has been shown time and again that buying quality is far cheaper than buying backyard bred dogs because the poorer quality dogs run up vet bills that dwarf the difference in purchase price. Bottom line is that if you want a Lhasa and cannot afford quality, you probably should not have a dog. This comes from over 35 years dog experience. less

The myth persists that there is something called "hybrid vigor", that crossbreds are inherently healthier than purebreds. Those who favor crossbreds are often subject to what is called "selection bias", that is, they select the data the fits their theory. If someone breeds a poodle with a recessive gene for hip and elbow dysplasia to a Labrador with the same recessive genes, the fact that the dog is an outcross does not cancel the recessives. If the recessives pair up, the dog will be dysplastic. We are noticing that many Labradoodles have more problems than their PB ancestors. One of the reasons to avoid puppy mills and pet shops is that responsible breeders will do everything they can to reduce the chances of occurrence of genetic problems. Go to a pet shop and ask for the OFA or PennHip certificate of the parents. Pet shops get these puppies from wholesalers who buy from mills. The wholesalers often have no idea who the parents are. The mills are run on a profit motive so they do not pay to have the parents checked for hereditary problems. Now if you get one of these mill dogs and breed it to a dog of a different breed also from a mill, why does anyone believe the problems will magically disappear? less

Many breeds once split into multiples who now maintain independent stud books - Cairns and West Highland White Terriers. There are breeds divided by size and which compete in different variety groups - Toy, Mini, and Standard Poodles - one stud book. On the Russell Terriers - If the short-legged JRT's compete directly against the longer-legged PRT's, one or the other type will begin to disappear. There was a reason for the two types. less

JRT's have always been more of a "type" then a "breed". There is such variation in size (10 to 15 inches) due to changes in their hunting style. Initially long-legged fox hunters and then as fox hunting declined more shorter legged dogs were bred for badger/rodent hunting. 

Personally I prefer having one type of Jack Russell Terrier that encompasses all these varieties that retain their keen hunting instincts. Rather then divide up the type into breeds for the purposes of showing. 

I also agree they are wonderful companions. I currently have 2 tall JRT's and one shorty. :) less
